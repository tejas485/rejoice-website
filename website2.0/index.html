<section id="about">
    <div class="section-title">About Me</div>
    <p>At Rejoice Estate Consultants, we're a team of passionate professionals with a vision for the future. While we've established ourselves in Mumbai's Western Suburbs through successful real estate investments and consultations, we believe there's a smarter way to navigate this dynamic market.</p>
    <p>Our core investment model has delivered strong yields, but we recognize its limitations. Growth hinges heavily on capital, especially in a city like Mumbai where property prices are a significant hurdle. This inspired us to explore a more scalable path.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, real estate services hold immense potential for growth, yet the industry remains largely unorganized and reliant on manual processes. This is precisely where we aim to disrupt the status quo.</p>
    <p>We're pioneering the future of real estate with cutting-edge AI and Large Language Model (LLM) solutions. By integrating automation and streamlining workflows, we're committed to transforming the way business is done in Mumbai's real estate landscape.</p>
    <p>Stay tuned as we pave the way for a more efficient, transparent, and data-driven real estate experience for all!</p>
